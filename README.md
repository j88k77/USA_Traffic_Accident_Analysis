# USA_Traffic_Accident_Analysis
Traffic Accident Data Analysis
Task Overview
This project involves analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis also focuses on visualizing accident hotspots and identifying contributing factors to help understand and potentially mitigate accidents.

Objective
Analyze traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends.
Identify correlations between accidents and variables such as road conditions, weather, and time of day.
Visualize accident hotspots and factors that may contribute to accidents.
Dataset
Source: Kaggle - US Accident EDA
The dataset provides detailed records of accidents with features such as location, time, road and weather conditions, etc.
Key Analysis Points
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and handle missing values to ensure accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution of accidents across different road and weather conditions.
Study the impact of time of day on accident occurrences.
Hotspot Identification:
Identify and visualize accident hotspots using geographic data.
Use visualization tools to highlight areas with high accident rates.
Contributing Factors:
Analyze correlations between various factors (e.g., weather, road conditions) and accident frequency.
